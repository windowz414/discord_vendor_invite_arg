Welcome to bonus branch! This branch will hold several bonus characters
I can't make ARG for and tips for the invite. Only if you kmow where to
look at though. Good luck!

```
#include <stdio.h>
```

First of all, the 5th character of the invite is `int(7)`.

Then the 8th character of the invite is `str("R")`.

And lastly, the 9th character of invite is `int(9)`.

For the big tip, check around this branch. ;)
